# Project Description

This project aims to evaluate creditworthiness using a multimodal approach by analyzing financial documents. The model combines image-based visual features and text-based insights extracted using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to predict a continuous creditworthiness score. Visual features are processed through a pre-trained ResNet50 deep learning model, while textual features are derived from OCR-extracted text and numerical transformations. The fusion of these features enables a comprehensive assessment of financial data, providing an innovative solution for credit scoring tasks.
